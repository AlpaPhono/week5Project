> BookMe web application

## Project Introduction
The objective of this project is to create and deploy a web application using the Flask micro-framework. 
The web app must support CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

## Application Design 
### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Coming up with a design that would showcase the different database relationships

The suggested sketch is a draft of what the final version of the database would look like. However, for the scope of this assignment the *Minium Usable SubseT*(MUST) is two tables that share a one to many relationship.

This ERD was created using the models function in workbench.

### Trello Kanban Board
I used Trello to create my kanban board, as it was suggested in the project brief.  I built off of the suggested template.

### Risk Assesment
At the start of the project a risk assesment was carried out. The diagram below contains some of the possible risks that could occur during the process of creating the application. The likelihood of the risks occuring are colour coded to match levels given in a supplimented Key. Red being high risk and green being unlikely.
A section for **Mitigations** was created to seperate from things that were currently implimented to things that could be considered further along the project.
